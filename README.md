# Agricultural Analysis

# Description

The table presents aggregated crop data by year, focusing on the year, the crop with maximum production, and the crop with minimum production.

This analysis highlights trends over the years, enabling identification of consistently high or low-performing crops, which aids in monitoring crop performance and resource allocation.

For instance, in 2023, wheat had the highest production while barley had the lowest. This data supports agricultural analysts, policymakers, and farmers in making informed decisions to improve crop yield and productivity.

The table includes pagination to manage large datasets efficiently, displaying 10 rows per page for easy navigation.

Also note that this application is completely responsive for all devices.
